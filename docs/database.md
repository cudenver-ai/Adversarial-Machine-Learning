# Database

For our databse we will be using sqlite3

we plan on replacing all of the json files with an actual databse.

Always git pull from production branch
- if you already made changes run
`git stash` to save your changes
`git pull` from production to pull the latest changes
`git stash apply`
- make changes

`git switch -c updates-routes`

this command will create a new branch and switch to it

- From here you can add and commit your changes
`git add .`
`git commit -m "My changes.."`
`git push origin updates-routed`

- Go to github and create a pull request
